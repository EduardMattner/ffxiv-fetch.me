		<h2 class="text-2xl">About</h2>
		<p>Greetings, I'm a web dev from Manitoba, Canada.</p>
		<p>This is the part where I explain what info is collected, and how much I value your privacy.</p>

		<h2 class="text-2xl">What is collected</h2>
		<h3 class="text-xl">By the website</h3>
		<p>By me, nothing. I don't ask for you email, address or credit card on this website. I made this for personal use and decided to share it with friends / anybody that plays FFXIV</p>

		<h2 class="text-2xl">3rd Party Scripts</h2>
		<h3 class="text-xl">AdSense</h3>
		<p>Donations unfortunately were not enough to pay for the time I spent on this, or continued maintenance. This seemed like a simple, un-skeevy revenue stream.</p>
		<p>According to AdSense they collect the following:</p>
		<ul class="mb-4 list-disc ml-6">
			<li>user IP addresses</li>
			<li>browsing histories</li>
			<li>website preferences</li>
			<li>device location</li>
			<li>device preferences</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="text-xl">Google Analytics</h3>
		<p>I was hesitant to add this, because I honestly just wanted to share a neat thing with people. But I haven't been playing all that much anymore, and I don't really want to sink a bunch of time into something that nobody is using. But if folks are enjoying it then I'd rather not just abandon it either.</p>
		<p>According to Google they collect the following information:</p>
		<ul class="mb-4 list-disc ml-6">
			<li>url of the visited page</li>
			<li>IP Address</li>
			<li>cookies may be Set</li>
			<li>existing cookies may be read</li>
			<li>probably some other stuff that they aren't open about</li>
		</ul>

		<hr class="mb-4">
		<p>And that's actually it, I hope you have a great day!</p>
